# Transfer Learning Project

This project implements Transfer Learning using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained with a publicly available dataset and is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to apply Transfer Learning techniques in deep learning for image classification tasks. The model leverages a pre-trained architecture to achieve high accuracy with a relatively small dataset.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Google Colab

## Getting Started

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Copy the code from the `transfer_learning.py` file.
3. Paste it into your Colab notebook.
4. Run the cells to train the model.

## Results

After training, the model will be evaluated, and you can test it with your own images.
